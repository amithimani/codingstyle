Sure! Here's a sample README file for the "codingstyle" project:

# codingstyle

The "codingstyle" project is a simple Maven project that compares the performance impact of functional coding style vs traditional coding style. It includes three classes: `Main`, `FunctionalWay`, and `TraditionalWay`.

## Project Structure

```
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
│           └── dev
│               └── knowledgecafe
│                   └── codingstyle
│                       ├── FunctionalWay.java
│                       ├── TraditionalWay.java
│                       └── Main.java
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

- `Main.java`: This class contains the main method to run the application and test the performance comparison between functional and traditional coding styles.
- `FunctionalWay.java`: This class implements the `searchString` method using functional programming techniques.
- `TraditionalWay.java`: This class implements the `searchString` method using traditional imperative coding style.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven configuration file for managing project dependencies and build settings.

## Running the Application

To run the application and compare the performance impact, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Maven installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
5. Once the build is successful, run the application using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar target/codingstyle.jar or you can run using IDE with main method
   ```
6. The application will execute the performance tests and display the results, comparing the functional and traditional coding styles for the `searchString` method.

## Customizing List Size

In the `Main` class, there is a variable named `randomStringListSize` that determines the size of the list used for performance testing. Modify this variable to adjust the size of the list as per your requirements.
